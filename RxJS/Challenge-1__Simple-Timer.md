# Challenge 1: Simple Timer
Objective
Understand how to create and subscribe to observables in RxJS using interval, take, and map. By the end of this task, the learner should be comfortable creating a timer observable and using it to display numbers in the UI.

Acceptance Criteria (AC):
- The timer should start when the component is initialized.
- The timer should increment the displayed value by 1 every second.
- The timer should stop automatically after displaying the number 10.
- The UI should display the current value of the timer.
- The implementation should not cause memory leaks (e.g., unsubscribing when the component is destroyed).
